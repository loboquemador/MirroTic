    Welcome to MirroTic!

    MirroTic is an innovative twist on the classic TicTacToe. In this game, you will experience the unique challenge of mirroring, where your moves in one grid are reflected in another, creating a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience.

    Key Concepts:

    Mirroring: At the beginning of each game rules are determined on how each placed X and O will be mirrored (x or y axis, or both) to another quadrant of the game area. 
    Scoring Points: MirroTic is not just about getting three in a row. Here, you score points based on the length of the lines you form. The longer the line, the higher the points. This means every move counts towards your final score.
